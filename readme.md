# Drone Face Recognition Project by Stefano Pedicino

Hello everybody,

I realized a project entirely in Python about face recognition. I trained my drone to recognize human faces and also to follow them. It was quite a challenging project and I often encountered difficulties that I managed to bypass! :) Even if the tuning phase could be further improved for the moment the final result looks pretty good to me!

Let me know if you liked the project! :)


The video showing the project it's available at the link below:
